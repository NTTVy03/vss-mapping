For SAE levels 3 and 4 the system is required to alert the driver before it will disengage. Level 4 systems are required to reach a safe state even if a driver does not take over. Only level 5 systems are required to not rely on a driver at all. While level 2 systems require the driver to be monitoring the system at all times, many level 2 systems, often termed \"level 2.5\" systems, do warn the driver shortly before reaching their operational limits, therefore we also support the DISENGAGING state for SAE_2.",
